1,"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP; also known as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy) is an entity that describes a group of related neuropathies, all having chronicity, demyelination, inflammation, and immune mediation in common."
2,"In the classic form of CIDP, motor involvement is greater than sensory. The clinical course of CIDP is slowly progressive in a majority of patients, but a relapsing-remitting course is noted in at least one-third and is more common in the pediatric age group."
3,"CIDP generally responds to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment with glucocorticoids, intravenous immune globulin, or plasma exchange."
4,"Early administration of effective treatment is important in CIDP. The goal is to stop the immune attack against the myelin sheath of peripheral nerves so that secondary axonal degeneration is minimized [1]. This can improve symptoms and function and can prevent or minimize long-term disability."
5,"The treatment approach depends on the severity and course of disease. While some patients with CIDP have such mild disease with minimal impact on function and quality of life that treatment is not required, most patients are significantly impaired and need treatment. Multiple medication trials may be required to optimize treatment response, particularly for patients with severe disease. Serial clinical examinations are used to monitor for relapses and guide changes in therapy."
6,"Once symptoms stabilize, and for patients who present with milder symptoms, the treatment objective is for sustained improvement and to promote remission."
7,"For most treatment-naïve patients with CIDP who are more than mildly affected or for mildly affected patients who are rapidly worsening, we recommend initial immune-modulatory treatment using either intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), plasma exchange, or glucocorticoids [2-4]. These treatments appear to be similarly effective and are considered first-line treatments by guidelines from the European Academy of Neurology and Peripheral Nerve Society [5-8]. The initial choice among these therapies is influenced by disease severity, concurrent illness, venous access, treatment side effects, availability, and cost."
8,"Patients with related chronic immune-mediated neuropathies due to nodal or paranodal antibodies (eg, neurofascin, contactin), however, may be unresponsive to typical initial therapies such as IVIG. For these patients, we prefer rituximab or other immunomodulatory therapies."
9,"Intravenous immune globulin — IVIG is an effective therapy for CIDP. We start treatment with IVIG when a rapid response is a priority. IVIG is usually easier to administer than plasma exchange and may have a more rapid response for disability improvement than with glucocorticoids."
10,"A number of small randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews have established that IVIG is effective for the short-term treatment of CIDP [3,7,10-15]. In one meta-analysis of five trials with a total of 269 patients, the rate of disability improvement within one month after treatment was significantly higher with IVIG than with placebo (44 versus 26 percent; risk ratio [RR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.72-3.36) [7]. To obtain improvement in one patient, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 3. Overall, IVIG improved disability for at least two to six weeks."
11,"More long-term outcome data are limited. During a 24-week extension phase of the ICE study, 57 initial-phase IVIG responders were randomly reassigned to IVIG or placebo [10]. Patients who continued to receive IVIG had a significantly longer time to relapse than those reassigned to placebo during this phase, and the relapse rate was significantly lower for patients treated with IVIG (13 versus 45 percent, hazard ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.70).
12,The meta-analysis [7] also identified small trials (20 to 46 patients each) that compared IVIG with plasma exchange [5], oral prednisolone [6], and intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone [15]. The benefit of IVIG appeared similar to that of plasma exchange, oral prednisolone, and IV methylprednisolone [7]."
13,"●Dosing regimens – The initial dose of IVIG is 2 g/kg infused over four to five days (eg, 0.4 g/kg per day for five days). Many patients with CIDP require a treatment trial of repeat IVIG dosing every two to four weeks depending on clinical course."
14,"For most patients, we repeat infusion of IVIG (1 g/kg) every three weeks for two to three months after the initial treatment before determining efficacy. Observation with objective measures should determine if the treatment is effective. Benefit may not be apparent after the first course of IVIG treatment, but 94 percent of IVIG responders in the ICE trial did so within nine weeks [14]."
15,"At the completion of the treatment trial, objective signs of efficacy should be evident to continue treatment. However, while progression of disease indicates treatment failure, stability in a patient who previously was progressing may indicate a treatment response and warrant continued treatment for another two to three months before reassessment of treatment efficacy. (See 'Assessing response to therapy' below and 'Inadequate response to initial therapy' below.)"
16,"●Adverse effects – IVIG use has been associated with headache, nausea, fever, aseptic meningitis, rash, acute renal failure (mostly related to sucrose-containing products), and rarely hyperviscosity and thrombosis. The most common adverse effects from clinical trials on patients with CIDP were transient headache, nausea, and fever [14,16,17]. In a meta-analysis, the risk of serious adverse effects for IVIG was similar to placebo (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36-1.87) [7]."
