Methods Antibodies to neurofascin-155 (Nfasc155), neurofascin-140/186 (Nfasc140/186), contactin-1 (CNTN1), and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) were detected with ELISA and/or cell-based assay. Antibody pathogenicity was tested by immunohistochemistry on skin biopsy, intraneural injection, and cell aggregation assay. Results Of 342 patients with CIDP, 19 (5.5%) had antibodies against Nfasc155 (n = 9), Nfasc140/186 and Nfasc155 (n = 1), CNTN1 (n = 3), and Caspr1 (n = 6). Antibodies were absent from healthy and disease controls, including neuropathies of different causes, and were mostly detected in patients with European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) definite CIDP (n = 18). Predominant antibody isotypes were immunoglobulin G (IgG)4 (n = 13), IgG3 (n = 2), IgG1 (n = 2), or undetectable (n = 2). IgG4 antibody-associated phenotypes included onset before 30 years, severe neuropathy, subacute onset, tremor, sensory ataxia, and poor response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immunosuppressive treatments, including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate, proved effective if started early in IVIG-resistant IgG4-seropositive cases. Five patients with an IgG1, IgG3, or undetectable isotype showed clinical features indistinguishable from seronegative patients, including good response to IVIG. IgG4 autoantibodies were associated with morphological changes at paranodes in patients' skin biopsies. We also provided preliminary evidence from a single patient about the pathogenicity of anti-Caspr1 IgG4, showing their ability to penetrate paranodal regions and disrupt the integrity of the Nfasc155/CNTN1/Caspr1 complex. Conclusions Our findings confirm previous data on the tight clinico-serological correlation between antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins and CIDP. Despite the low prevalence, testing for their presence and isotype could ultimately be part of the diagnostic workup in suspected inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment. Classification of evidence This study provides Class III evidence that antibodies to nodal/paranodal proteins identify patients with CIDP (sensitivity 6%, specificity 100%).",100,['JournalArticle']

Methods We screened 43 human serum samples, of which 22 were from patients with CIDP, 12 from patients with other neuropathies, and 9 from healthy controls via HuProt Human Proteome microarrays testing about 16,000 distinct human bait proteins. Autoantigen repertoires were analyzed via bioinformatical autoantigenomic approaches: principal component analysis, analysis of the repertoire sizes in disease groups and clinical subgroups, and overrepresentation analyses using Gene Ontology and PantherDB. Results The autoantigen repertoires enabled the identification of a subgroup of 10/22 patients with CIDP with a younger age at onset and a higher frequency of mixed motor and sensory CIDP. IV immunoglobulin therapy responders targeted 3 times more autoantigens than nonresponders. No CIDP-specific autoantibody is present in all patients; however, anchoring junction components were significantly targeted by 86.4% of patients with CIDP. There are potential novel CIDP-specific autoantigens such as the myelination- or axo-glial structure–related proteins actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1B, band 4.1-like protein 2, cadherin-15, cytohesin-1, epidermal growth factor receptor, ezrin, and radixin. Conclusions The repertoire of targeted autoantigens of patients with CIDP differs in a systematic degree from those of controls. Systematic autoantigenomic approaches can help to understand the disease and to discover novel bioinformatical tools and novel autoantigen panels to improve diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, or patient stratification.",8,['JournalArticle']

Methods We performed retrospective immunoassay of IL-8 in CSF, collected at the University Hospitals of Geneva between 2010 and 2018, from patients diagnosed with GBS (n = 45) and with CIDP (n = 30) according to the Brighton and European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria by a physician blinded to biological results. Results CSF IL-8 was higher in GBS (median: 83.9 pg/mL) than in CIDP (41.0 pg/mL) (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that the optimal IL-8 cutoff was 70 pg/mL. Above this value, patients were more likely to present GBS than CIDP (specificity 96.7%, sensitivity 64.4%, positive predictive value [PPV] 96.7%, and negative predictive value [NPV] 64.4%). Among GBS subcategories, IL-8 was higher in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP, median: 101.8 pg/mL) than in other GBS variants (median: 53.7 pg/mL). In addition, with CSF IL-8 above 70 pg/mL, patients were more likely to present AIDP than acute-onset CIDP (p < 0.001; specificity 100%, sensitivity 78.8%, PPV 100%, and NPV 46.2%) or other CIDP with nonacute presentation (p < 0.0001; specificity 95.8%, sensitivity 78.8%, PPV 96.3%, and NPV 76.7%). Conclusion CSF IL-8 levels can help to differentiate AIDP variant of GBS from CIDP, including acute-onset CIDP, with high specificity and PPV. This may improve early and appropriate treatment. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class II evidence that CSF IL-8 levels accurately distinguish patients with GBS from those with CIDP.",5,['JournalArticle']

Methods We prospectively enrolled 184 patients from six Italian referral centres, in whom CSF SM levels were quantified by a fluorescence-based assay optimised and patented in our laboratory. Results We confirmed increased levels of SM in the CSF of patients affected by typical CIDP (n=35), atypical CIDP (n=18) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, AIDP (n=12) compared with patients affected by non-demyelinating neurological diseases, used as controls (n=85) (p<0.0001, p=0.0065 and p<0.0001, respectively). In patients with CIDP classified for disease stage, SM was higher in active CIDP compared with both controls and stable CIDP (p<0.0001), applying for a selective tool to treatment tailoring or withdrawal. SM was also increased in AIDP compared with axonal GBS, discerning the demyelinating from axonal variant of the disease. SM did not correlate with CSF protein levels, stratifying patients independently from commonly used CSF indexes, and displaying high specificity to avoid potential misdiagnosis. Finally, SM correlated with the main clinical scores and some neurophysiological parameters in patients with CIDP and AIDP. Conclusions CSF SM is a diagnostic and staging wet biomarker for acquired demyelinating neuropathies and may effectively improve the management of patients affected by GBS and CIDP.",15,['JournalArticle']

Recently, studies identified a subgroup of patients with CIDP who were positive for IgG4 autoantibodies against paranodal proteins, such as neurofascin-155 and contactin-1, who respond poorly to first-line therapies for typical CIDP, including intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Objective This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous rituximab according to IgG4 autoantibody status in patients with refractory CIDP. Methods The Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Rituximab in Refractory CIDP Patients with IgG4 Autoantibodies in the Exploratory Clinical (RECIPE) trial consists of 2 cohorts: a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized study cohort of 15 patients with IgG4 autoantibody-positive CIDP (rituximab:placebo = 2:1) and an open-label trial cohort of 10 patients with antibody-negative CIDP. The primary endpoint is improvement in functional outcome assessed using the adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Disability Scale score at 26, 38, or 52 weeks after the start of treatment with rituximab in patients with CIDP and anti-paranodal protein antibodies. Secondary outcome measures include grip strength, manual muscle testing sum scores, results of nerve conduction studies, and other functional scales. Results We plan to enroll 25 cases for the full analysis set. Recruitment is ongoing, with 14 patients enrolled as of January 2020. Enrollment will close in September 2020, and the study is planned to end in December 2021. Conclusions This randomized controlled trial will determine if rituximab is safe and effective in patients with anti-paranodal antibodies. An open-label study will provide additional data on the effects of rituximab in patients with antibody-negative CIDP. The results of the RECIPE trial are expected to provide evidence for the positioning of rituximab as a pathogenesis-based therapeutic for refractory CIDP.

We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with a clinical diagnosis of CIDP included in a national database.

In 352 patients (86%) motor nerve conduction abnormalities consistent with demyelination were sufficient for the diagnosis of definite CIDP. In 55 patients, this diagnosis required the addition of one or two (from probable or from possible CIDP, respectively) supportive tests, while in 20 cases they improved the diagnosis from possible to probable CIDP, seven patients did not change diagnosis. Considering these 85 patients, cerebrospinal fluid studies were performed in 79 cases (93%) upgrading the certainty of diagnosis in 59% of examined patients. Sensory nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed in 85% of patients with an improvement of diagnosis in 32% of cases. Nerve biopsy and ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (US/MRI) exams resulted positive in about 40% of examined patients, but they were performed in few patients (7 patients and 16 patients, respectively). A response to the therapy was present in 84% of treated patients (n = 77), contributing to support the diagnosis in 40 patients in whom the other supportive criteria were not sufficient. In most patients with CIDP the diagnosis is possible solely with motor NCS while other investigations may help improving the diagnosis in a minority of patients.",10,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']"

We aimed to study their clinical and electrophysiological characteristics and response to treatment. From a prospective database of CIDP patients, we included patients with definite or probable CIDP with motor signs and without sensory signs/symptoms at diagnosis. Patients were considered to have pure motor CIDP (PM‐CIDP) if sensory conductions were normal or to have motor predominant CIDP (MPred‐CIDP) if ≥2 sensory nerve action potential amplitudes were abnormal. Among the 700 patients with CIDP, 17 (2%) were included (PM‐CIDP n = 7, MPred‐CIDP n = 10); 71% were male, median age at onset was 48 years (range: 13‐76 years), 47% had an associated inflammatory or infectious disease or neoplasia. At the more severe disease stage, 94% of patients had upper and lower limb weakness, with distal and proximal weakness in 4 limbs for 56% of them. Three‐quarters (75%) responded to intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and four of five patients to corticosteroids including three of three patients with MPred‐CIDP. The most frequent conduction abnormalities were conduction blocks (CB, 82%) and F‐wave abnormalities (88%). During follow up, 4 of 10 MPred‐CIDP patients developed mild sensory symptoms; none with PM‐CIDP did so. Patients with PM‐CIDP had poorer outcome (median ONLS: 4; range: 22‐5) compared to MPred‐CIDP (2, range: 0‐4; P = .03) at last follow up. This study found a progressive clinical course in the majority of patients with motor CIDP as well as frequent associated diseases, CB, and F‐wave abnormalities.

Methods We applied a set of diagnostic criteria to 460 patients included in a database of Italian patients with CIDP. Clinical characteristics and treatment response were reviewed for each patient. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate the progression rate from atypical to typical CIDP. Results At the time of inclusion, 376 (82%) patients had a diagnosis of typical CIDP while 84 (18%) had atypical CIDP, including 34 (7%) with distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy (DADS), 17 (4%) with purely motor, 17 (4%) with Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS) and 16 (3.5%) with purely sensory CIDP. Based on retrospective review of the symptoms and signs present at onset and for at least 1 year, 180 (39%) patients had an initial diagnosis compatible with atypical CIDP that in 96 (53%) patients evolved to typical CIDP. Mean disease duration was longer in patients evolving to typical CIDP than in those not evolving (p=0.0016). Patients with DADS and LSS had a less frequent response to immunoglobulin than those with typical CIDP, while patients with purely motor and sensory CIDP had a similar treatment response. Conclusions The proportion of patients with atypical CIDP varies during the disease course. DADS and LSS have a less frequent response to intravenous immunoglobulin compared with typical CIDP, raising the possibility of a different underlying pathogenetic mechanism.",90,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']"

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic progressive or relapsing and remitting disease that usually causes weakness and sensory loss. The symptoms are due to autoimmune inflammation of peripheral nerves. CIPD affects about 2 to 3 per 100,000 of the population. More than half of affected people cannot walk unaided when symptoms are at their worst. CIDP usually responds to treatments that reduce inflammation, but there is disagreement about which treatment is most effective.


OBJECTIVES
To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of any treatment for CIDP and to compare the effects of treatments.


METHODS
We considered all systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment for any form of CIDP. We reported their primary outcomes, giving priority to change in disability after 12 months.Two overview authors independently identified published systematic reviews for inclusion and collected data. We reported the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. Two other review authors independently checked review selection, data extraction and quality assessments.On 31 October 2016, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (in theCochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus for systematic reviews of CIDP. We supplemented the RCTs in the existing CSRs by searching on the same date for RCTs of any treatment of CIDP (including treatment of fatigue or pain in CIDP), in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus.


MAIN RESULTS
Five CSRs met our inclusion criteria. We identified 23 randomised trials, of which 15 had been included in these CSRs. We were unable to compare treatments as originally planned, because outcomes and outcome intervals differed. CorticosteroidsIt is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone improved impairment compared to no treatment because the quality of the evidence was very low (1 trial, 28 participants). According to moderate-quality evidence (1 trial, 41 participants), six months' treatment with high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone did not improve disability more than daily oral prednisolone. Observational studies tell us that prolonged use of corticosteroids sometimes causes serious side-effects. Plasma exchangeAccording to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 59 participants), twice-weekly plasma exchange produced more short-term improvement in disability than sham exchange. In the largest observational study, 3.9% of plasma exchange procedures had complications. Intravenous immunoglobulinAccording to high-quality evidence (5 trials, 269 participants), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) produced more short-term improvement than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo (high-quality evidence), but serious adverse events were not (moderate-quality evidence, 3 trials, 315 participants). One trial with 19 participants provided moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in short-term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange in comparison to IVIg. There was little or no difference in short-term improvement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone (moderate-quality evidence; 1 trial, 29 participants) or intravenous methylprednisolone (high-quality evidence; 1 trial, 45 participants). One unpublished randomised open trial with 35 participants found little or no difference in disability after three months of IVIg compared to oral prednisone; this trial has not yet been included in a CSR. We know from observational studies that serious adverse events related to IVIg do occur. Other immunomodulatory treatmentsIt is uncertain whether the addition of azathioprine (2 mg/kg) to prednisone improved impairment in comparison to prednisone alone, as the quality of the evidence is very low (1 trial, 27 participants). Observational studies show that adverse effects truncate treatment in 10% of people.According to low-quality evidence (1 trial, 60 participants), compared to placebo, methotrexate 15 mg/kg did not allow more participants to reduce corticosteroid or IVIg doses by 20%. Serious adverse events were no more common with methotrexate than with placebo, but observational studies show that methotrexate can cause teratogenicity, abnormal liver function, and pulmonary fibrosis.According to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 77 participants), interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) in comparison to placebo, did not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. According to moderate-quality evidence, serious adverse events were no more common with IFN beta-1a than with placebo.We know of no other completed trials of immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory agents for CIDP. Other treatmentsWe identified no trials of treatments for fatigue or pain in CIDP. Adverse effectsNot all trials routinely collected adverse event data; when they did, the quality of evidence was variable. Adverse effects in the short, medium, and long term occur with all interventions. We are not able to make reliable comparisons of adverse events between the interventions included in CSRs.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
We cannot be certain based on available evidence whether daily oral prednisone improves impairment compared to no treatment. However, corticosteroids are commonly used, based on widespread availability, low cost, very low-quality evidence from observational studies, and clinical experience. The weakness of the evidence does not necessarily mean that corticosteroids are ineffective. High-dose monthly oral dexamethasone for six months is probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone. Plasma exchange produces short-term improvement in impairment as determined by neurological examination, and probably produces short-term improvement in disability. IVIg produces more short-term improvement in disability than placebo and more adverse events, although serious side effects are probably no more common than with placebo. There is no clear difference in short-term improvement in impairment with IVIg when compared with intravenous methylprednisolone and probably no improvement when compared with either oral prednisolone or plasma exchange. According to observational studies, adverse events related to difficult venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes occur in 3% to17% of plasma exchange procedures.It is uncertain whether azathioprine is of benefit as the quality of evidence is very low. Methotrexate may not be of benefit and IFN beta-1a is probably not of benefit.We need further research to identify predictors of response to different treatments and to compare their long-term benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness. There is a need for more randomised trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, routes of administration, and treatments for symptoms of CIDP.",123,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']"

To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of weekly subcutaneous IgPro20 (Hizentra, CSL Behring) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).


METHODS
In a 48-week open-label prospective extension study to the PATH study, patients were initially started on 0.2 g/kg or on 0.4 g/kg weekly and-if clinically stable-switched to 0.2 g/kg weekly after 24 weeks. Upon CIDP relapse on the 0.2 g/kg dose, 0.4 g/kg was (re)initiated. CIDP relapse was defined as a deterioration by at least 1 point in the total adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment score.


RESULTS
Eighty-two patients were enrolled. Sixty-two patients initially received 0.4 g/kg, 20 patients 0.2 g/kg weekly. Seventy-two received both doses during the study. Sixty-six patients (81%) completed the 48-week study duration. Overall relapse rates were 10% in 0.4 g/kg-treated patients and 48% in 0.2 g/kg-treated patients. After dose reduction from 0.4 to 0.2 g/kg, 51% (27/53) of patients relapsed, of whom 92% (24 of 26) improved after reinitiation of the 0.4 g/kg dose. Two-thirds of patients (19/28) who completed the PATH study without relapse remained relapse-free on the 0.2 g/kg dose after dose reduction in the extension study. Sixty-two patients had adverse events (AEs) (76%), of which most were mild or moderate with no related serious AEs.


CONCLUSIONS
Subcutaneous treatment with IgPro20 provided long-term benefit at both 0.4 and 0.2 g/kg weekly doses with lower relapse rates on the higher dose. Long-term dosing should be individualized to find the most appropriate dose in a given patient.


CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE

Recent advances in the search for autoantibodies against components expressed at nodal regions, such as the nodes of Ranvier and paranodes, have substantially contributed to clarifying the pathogenesis of CIDP in a subpopulation of patients. In particular, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibodies to paranodal junction proteins, including neurofascin-155 and contactin-1, have attracted the attention of researchers. Paranodal dissection resulting from the attachment of IgG4 at paranodal junctions and the absence of macrophage-induced demyelination are characteristic pathologic features in patients who have these antibodies. By contrast, the mechanisms of neuropathy in cases with classical macrophage-induced demyelination remain unclear despite the long-standing recognition of this process in CIDP. In addition to complement-dependent damage provoked by autoantibodies, recent studies have shed light on antibody-dependent phagocytosis by macrophages without participation of complements. However, a direct association between specific autoantibodies and macrophage-induced demyelination has not been reported. Electron microscopic examination of longitudinal sections of sural nerve biopsy specimens suggested that macrophages recognize specific sites of myelinated fibers as the initial target of demyelination. The site that macrophages select to initiate myelin breakdown is located around the nodal regions in some patients and internode in others. Hence, it seems that the components that distinguish between the nodal regions and internode play a pivotal role in the behavior of macrophages that initiate phagocytosis of myelin. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying macrophage-induced demyelination from this perspective.",45,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']"

Methods In a 48-week open-label prospective extension study to the PATH study, patients were initially started on 0.2 g/kg or on 0.4 g/kg weekly and—if clinically stable—switched to 0.2 g/kg weekly after 24 weeks. Upon CIDP relapse on the 0.2 g/kg dose, 0.4 g/kg was (re)initiated. CIDP relapse was defined as a deterioration by at least 1 point in the total adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment score. Results Eighty-two patients were enrolled. Sixty-two patients initially received 0.4 g/kg, 20 patients 0.2 g/kg weekly. Seventy-two received both doses during the study. Sixty-six patients (81%) completed the 48-week study duration. Overall relapse rates were 10% in 0.4 g/kg–treated patients and 48% in 0.2 g/kg–treated patients. After dose reduction from 0.4 to 0.2 g/kg, 51% (27/53) of patients relapsed, of whom 92% (24 of 26) improved after reinitiation of the 0.4 g/kg dose. Two-thirds of patients (19/28) who completed the PATH study without relapse remained relapse-free on the 0.2 g/kg dose after dose reduction in the extension study. Sixty-two patients had adverse events (AEs) (76%), of which most were mild or moderate with no related serious AEs. Conclusions Subcutaneous treatment with IgPro20 provided long-term benefit at both 0.4 and 0.2 g/kg weekly doses with lower relapse rates on the higher dose. Long-term dosing should be individualized to find the most appropriate dose in a given patient.

Methods: Immunocytochemistry was used to identify antibodies to neurofascin 155 (NF155) and 186. Serum reactivity with paranodes and brain tissue was tested with immunohistochemistry of teased-nerve fibers and rat brain. Antibody titers and immunoglobulin (Ig) G isotypes were determined using ELISA. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively. Results: Two of 53 patients, but none of 204 controls, had antibodies to NF155 (p = 0.041). The 2 patients with NF155 antibodies developed severe polyradiculoneuropathy with predominant distal weakness that was refractory to IVIg. Eight additional patients with IVIg-refractory CIDP were then identified from a national database; 2 of them with the same clinical features also had NF155 antibodies. Overall, 3 of the 4 patients with NF155 antibodies had a disabling and characteristic tremor (high amplitude, low frequency, postural, and intention). Patients' antibodies reacted with the paranodes in teased-nerve fibers and with the neuropil of rat cerebellum, brain, and brainstem. Anti-NF155 antibodies were predominantly of the IgG4 isotype in all patients. Conclusion: Patients with CIDP positive for IgG4 NF155 antibodies constitute a specific subgroup with a severe phenotype, poor response to IVIg, and disabling tremor. Autoantibodies against paranodal structures associate with distinct clinical features in CIDP and their identification has diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that autoantibodies to NF155 identify a CIDP subtype characterized by severe neuropathy, poor response to IVIg, and disabling tremor.",274,['JournalArticle']

To investigate the efficacy and safety of the IVIG IgPro10 (Privigen) for treatment of CIDP, results from Privigen Impact on Mobility and Autonomy (PRIMA), a prospective, open‐label, single‐arm study of IVIG in immunoglobulin (Ig)‐naïve or IVIG pre‐treated subjects (NCT01184846, n = 28) and Polyneuropathy And Treatment with Hizentra (PATH), a double‐blind, randomized study including an open‐label, single‐arm IVIG phase in IVIG pre‐treated subjects (NCT01545076, IVIG restabilization phase n = 207) were analyzed separately and together (n = 235). Efficacy assessments included change in adjusted inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment (INCAT) score, grip strength and Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and ADRs/infusion were recorded. Adjusted INCAT response rate was 60.7% in all PRIMA subjects at Week 25 (76.9% in IVIG pre‐treated subjects) and 72.9% in PATH. In the pooled cohort (n = 235), INCAT response rate was 71.5%; median time to INCAT improvement was 4.3 weeks. No clear demographic differences were noticed between early (responding before Week 7, n = 148) and late responders (n = 21). In the pooled cohort, median change from baseline to last observation was −1.0 (interquartile range −2.0; 0.0) point for INCAT score; +8.0 (0.0; 20.0) kPa for maximum grip strength; +3.0 (1.0; 7.0) points for MRC sum score. In the pooled cohort, 271 ADRs were reported in 105 subjects (44.7%), a rate of 0.144 ADRs per infusion.

The role of lifestyle and dietary habits and antecedent events has not been clearly identified in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).


METHODS
We collected information about modifiable environmental factors and antecedent infections and vaccinations in patients with CIDP included in an Italian CIDP database. Only patients who reported not having changed their diet or the lifestyle habits investigated in the study after the appearance of CIDP were included. The partners of patients with CIDP were chosen as controls. Gender-matched analysis was performed with randomly-selected controls with a 1:1 ratio between patients and controls.


RESULTS
Dietary and lifestyle data of 323 patients and 266 controls were available. A total of 195 cases and 195 sex-matched controls were used in the analysis. Patients eating rice at least three times per week or eating fish at least once per week appeared to be at decreased risk of acquiring CIDP. Data on antecedent events were collected in 411 patients. Antecedent events within 1-42 days before CIDP onset were reported by 15.5% of the patients, including infections in 12% and vaccinations in 1.5%. Patients with CIDP and antecedent infections more often had an acute onset of CIDP and cranial nerve involvement than those without these antecedent events.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this preliminary study seem to indicate that some dietary habits may influence the risk of CIDP and that antecedent infections may have an impact on the onset and clinical presentation of the disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",10,['JournalArticle']

Methods: A retrospective study of 59 consecutive patients referred with a diagnosis of CIDP was performed. Patients were classified as having or not having CIDP according to European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria. Diagnostic and treatment data were compared in the 2 groups. Results: Forty-seven percent of patients referred with a diagnosis of CIDP failed to meet minimal CIDP diagnostic requirements. All misdiagnosed patients who satisfied EFNS/PNS clinical criteria would be considered atypical as defined by the EFNS/PNS. CSF cytoalbuminologic dissociation was present in 50% of those without CIDP, although protein elevations were generally mild. Nerve conduction studies in patients without CIDP were heterogeneous, but generally showed demyelinating features better explained by a process other than CIDP. Patients frequently reported improvements after being treated with immunotherapy, even if the CIDP diagnosis was incorrect. Conclusions: CIDP misdiagnosis is common. Over-reliance on subjective patient-reported perception of treatment benefit, liberal electrophysiologic interpretation of demyelination, and placing an overstated importance on mild or moderate cytoalbuminologic dissociation are common diagnostic errors. Utilization of clear and objective indicators of treatment efficacy might improve our ability to make informed treatment decisions.",165,['JournalArticle']

Hypertrophy/signal hyperintensity, and/or gadolinium enhancement of plexus structures on MRI are observed in two-thirds of cases of typical chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The objective of our study was to determine the additional benefit of plexus MRI in patients referred to tertiary centers with baseline clinical and electrophysiological characteristics suggestive of typical or atypical CIDP.


METHODS
Twenty-eight consecutive patients with initial suspicion of CIDP were recruited in nine centers and followed for two years. Plexus MRI data from the initial assessment were reviewed centrally. Physicians blinded to the plexus MRI findings established the final diagnosis (CIDP or neuropathy of another cause). The proportion of patients with abnormal MRI was analyzed in each group.


RESULTS
CIDP was confirmed in 14 (50%) patients, as were sensory-motor CIDP (n=6), chronic immune sensory polyradiculoneuropathy (n=2), motor CIDP (n=1), and multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (n=5). Thirty-seven plexus MRI were performed (17 brachial, 19 lumbosacral, and 8 in both localizations). MRI was abnormal in 5/37 (14%) patients, all of whom were subsequently diagnosed with CIDP (5/14=36%), after an atypical baseline presentation. With plexus MRI results masked, non-invasive procedures confirmed the diagnosis of CIDP in all but one patient (1/14=7%). Knowledge of the abnormal MRI findings in the latter could have prevented nerve biopsy being performed.


CONCLUSION
Systematic plexus MRI in patients with initially suspected CIDP provides little additional benefit in confirming the diagnosis of CIDP. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",4,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']"

Thus, we used a multiplex semi-quantitative line immunoassay (LIA) to search for aGAAb in chronic-inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and its clinical variants. Methods: Anti-GAAb to 11 gangliosides and sulfatide (SF) were investigated by LIA in 61 patients with IN (27 typical CIDP, 12 distal-acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy, 6 multifocal-acquired demyelinating sensory/motor polyneuropathy, 10 sensory CIDP, 1 focal CIDP and 5 multifocal-motoric neuropathy), 40 with other neuromuscular disorders (OND) (15 non-immune polyneuropathies, 25 myasthenia gravis), 29 with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 54 healthy controls (HC). Results: In contrast to IgG, positive anti-GAAB IgM against at least one ganglioside/SF was found in 17/61 (27.9%) IN compared to 2/40 (5%) in OND, 2/29 MS (6.9%) and 4/54 (7.4%) in HC (p=0.001). There was a statistically higher prevalence of anti-sulfatide (aSF) IgM in IN compared to OND (p=0.008). Further, aGM1 IgM was more prevalent in IN compared to OND and HC (p=0.009) as well as GD1b in IN compared to HC (p<0.04). The prevalence of aGM1 IgM in CIDP was lower compared to in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) (12% vs. 60%, p=0.027). Patients showing aSF, aGM1 and aGM2 IgM were younger compared to aGAAb negatives (p<0.05). Patients with aSF IgM positivity presented more frequently typical CIDP and MMN phenotypes (p<0.05, respectively). Conclusions: The aGAAb LIA revealed an elevated frequency of at least one aGAAb IgM in CIDP/MMN patients.

IVIg dosage is not universal and markers for treatment management are needed. Methods: We report the response to high-dose and fractioned IVIg in a subgroup of definite CIDP patients, resistant to corticosteroids and PE, responders to IVIg but with an efficacy window <15 d. Results: Four patients were included with similar predominantly clinical motor form and conduction abnormalities. Treatment management consisted of fractioning IVIg and increasing the monthly cumulated dose (mean: 3 g/kg/month). Serum IgG concentration was measured and correlated to the clinical state. Monitoring of serum IgG helped to guide IVIg administration dosage and frequency. A mean of 10 months was required to improve symptoms; therapy was then switched to subcutaneous (SC) route (maintenance dose: 3.5 g/kg/month). The mean Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale was improved from 11 to 3.2 and the mean Medical Research Council scale from 26 to 90. Conclusion: It is important to distinguish patients with short IVIg efficacy window from those with classical resistance since the former may benefit from fractioning and increasing the IVIg dose.

The economic burden of CIDP is not well understood. Objectives To assess the economic and clinical burden of CIDP and to compare the incremental burden relative to a matched control group without CIDP. Methods This retrospective case-control analysis was conducted using data from the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims. Adults newly diagnosed with CIDP between 7/1/2010 and 6/30/2014 were identified and direct matched to controls without CIDP. Baseline characteristics were assessed and compared over a 6-month pre-index period. Healthcare resource use, costs and clinical characteristics were assessed and compared over a 2-year follow-up. Total cost differences over the 2-year follow-up were compared between matched cohorts using a generalized estimating equation model. Results The final sample comprised a total of 790 cases matched to 790 controls. Over the 2-year follow-up, cases more frequently experienced neuropathic pain, back pain and osteoarthritis and more commonly utilized opioids, anti-convulsants and anti-depressants. Compared to controls, more cases had ≥1 hospitalization (26.2% vs. 9.0%), and cases had a higher mean number of outpatient prescription fills (62.8 vs. 32.0) and physician office visits (34.7 vs. 13.0) (all p<0.0001). Cases had 7.5x higher mean total costs ($116,330 vs. $15,586, p<0.0001). Important cost drivers were costs for outpatient ancillary, radiology and HCPCS drugs (mean $76,366 vs. $4,292) and costs for inpatient care (mean $16,357 vs. $2,862) (both p<0.0001). Among cases, CIDP therapy (inclusive of both outpatient pharmacy and medical claims) accounted for 51.2% of mean total costs. After further adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, cases were associated with a 6.1x increase in total costs compared to controls (p<0.0001).

We report a case of SLE presenting as CIDP and discuss the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of CIDP. Case Report: A 40-year-old woman with a past medical history of SLE treated with hydroxychloroquine presented with bilateral, progressive, ascending, sensory and motor neuropathy. Physical examination showed weakness and reduced temperature of all extremities, reduced pinprick and vibration sense of the distal extremities, loss of reflexes, and walking with a wide-based unsteady gait. Laboratory investigations showed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-(smooth muscle (SM) antibody, anti-RNP antibody, anti-SSA antibody, anti-ds-DNA antibody, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 75 mm/hr, low C4, leukopenia, and anemia. Electromyography (EMG) confirmed the diagnosis of CIDP. The patient’s neuropathy and muscle weakness improved on treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose steroids. Conclusions: The early clinical diagnosis of CIDP, supported by serological autoantibody profiles associated with SLE, can predict a good response to steroids. Most patients with CIDP are treated successfully with steroids if the diagnosis is made early. IVIG, plasmapheresis, or immunosuppressive therapy should be considered if there is no response to steroids.",15,"['JournalArticle', 'CaseReport']"

All patients underwent a neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each group. Results: US changes, characterized by an increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p < 0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p = 0.001) or in segments with normal EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R = 0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p = 0.001). Conclusions: US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP. US and EDX changes are correlated.",87,"['Study', 'JournalArticle']"

We also quantified the volumes of the brachial and lumbar plexus and their nerve roots. Methods: Thirteen patients with CIDP and 12 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Whole‐body MR neurography based on diffusion‐weighted whole‐body imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) was performed. Peripheral nerve volumes were calculated from serial axial MR images. Results: The peripheral nervous system was visualized with 3‐dimensional reconstruction. Volumes ranged from 8.7 to 49.5 cm3/m2 in the brachial plexus and nerve roots and from 10.2 to 53.5 cm3/m2 in the lumbar plexus and nerve roots. Patients with CIDP had significantly larger volumes than controls (P < 0.05), and volume was positively correlated with disease duration. Conclusions: MR neurography and the measurement of peripheral nerve volume are useful for diagnosing and assessing CIDP. Muscle Nerve 55: 483–489, 2017",33,['JournalArticle']

Methods: Eight consecutive patients, four with MMN and four with CIDP, already on long-term, hospital-based IVIG were switched to home-based SCIG. These patients were selected on the basis of their requirement for relatively low treatment doses, problems experienced with IVIG, and their willingness to switch to SCIG. Results: After a mean 33 [standard deviation (SD) 19] months receiving SCIG, 7 patients remained neurologically stable and 6 remained on a similar mean weekly immunoglobulin dose relative to their original intravenous dose. A good outcome was reported by 7 of the 8 patients: there were improvements in nausea and headache (n = 4), need to travel to hospital (n = 4), venous access problems (n = 3), immunoglobulin-induced neutropenia (n = 3), treatment wearing-off fluctuations (n = 2), IVIG-induced allergy requiring antihistamine/hydrocortisone (n = 1) and time taken off work (n = 1). The eighth patient required increasing doses of immunoglobulin to maintain strength but still wanted to continue SCIG. Seven patients completed a questionnaire: there was a very high overall satisfaction level with immunoglobulin treatment [mean 96 (SD 5), visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 = very unsatisfied, 100 = very satisfied]; and very strong preference for subcutaneous over intravenous immunoglobulin (VAS mean 93 [SD 12] where 0 = prefer IVIG, 100 = prefer SCIG). Conclusions: In seven of the eight patients, SCIG gave improved tolerability and patient satisfaction with similar efficacy compared with IVIG.",54,['JournalArticle']

While both cell‐mediated and humoral mechanisms contribute to its pathogenesis, the rapid clinical response to plasmapheresis implicates a circulating factor responsible for peripheral nerve injury. We report that treatment‐naïve patients with CIDP show increased serum and CSF levels of the anaphylatoxin C5a and the soluble terminal complement complex (sTCC). Systemic terminal complement activation correlates with clinical disease severity as determined by the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability scale. These data indicate that complement activation contributes to peripheral nerve injury and suggest that complement inhibition should be explored for its potential therapeutic merit in CIDP.",19,['JournalArticle']

Methods IFN-γ-response as well as antibodies against the (para)nodal antigens neurofascin (NF)155 and NF 186 had been tested by Elispot assay and ELISA before clinical manifestation and at follow-up. Case description and results The patient described here developed a subacute brainstem syndrome more than 10 years after diagnosis of CIDP under low-dose maintenance treatment of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). MRI revealed enhancing right-sided pontocerebellar lesion. CSF examination showed mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, and negative oligoclonal bands. Further diagnostics exclude differential diagnoses such as tuberculoma, sarcoidosis, or metastasis. Specific IFN-γ response against NF155 and NF186 as measured by Elispot assay was elevated before clinical manifestation. NF155 and NF186 antibodies were negative. Escalation of IVIG treatment at 2 g/kg BW followed by 1.4 g/kg BW led to clinical remission albeit to a new asymptomatic central lesion. Follow-up NF155 and NF186-Elispot turned negative. Conclusion The case reported here with a delayed central manifestation after an initially typical CIDP and NF155 and NF186 T cell responses does not resemble described cases of combined central and peripheral demyelination but may reflect a novel subtype within the great clinical heterogeneity of CIDP.",9,['CaseReport']

We now retrospectively compared the proportion of patients who eventually worsened after discontinuing therapy and the median time to clinical worsening. Methods By March 2013, data were available from 41 of the 45 patients completing the trial with a median follow-up after therapy discontinuation of 42 months (range 1–60). Three patients withdrew during the original study and one failed to respond to either of the therapies. No patient received a diagnosis alternative to CIDP during the follow-up. Results Twenty-eight of the 32 patients treated with IVIg (as primary or secondary therapy after failing to respond to IVMP) improved after therapy (87.5%) as compared with 13 of the 24 patients treated with IVMP as primary or secondary therapy (54.2%). After a median follow-up of 42 months (range 1–57), 24 out of 28 patients responsive to IVIg (85.7%) worsened after therapy discontinuation. The same occurred in 10 out of 13 patients (76.9%) responsive to IVMP (p=0.659) after a median follow-up of 43 months (range 7–60). Worsening occurred 1–24 months (median 4.5) after IVIg discontinuation and 1–31 months (median 14) after IVMP discontinuation (p=0.0126). Conclusions A similarly high proportion of patients treated with IVIg or IVMP eventually relapse after therapy discontinuation but the median time to relapse was significantly longer after IVMP than IVIg. This difference may help to balance the more frequent response to IVIg than to IVMP in patients with CIDP.",62,['JournalArticle']

The non-inferiority of SCIg over IVIg has been recently confirmed by a 4-month multicentre Italian observational study,1 where a similar efficacy was observed between the two therapies, with the SCIg showing possible advantages of stable plasmatic concentration2 and independence from hospital care. Here we report the 2-year experience of six Italian Neurological Centres, describing the long-term clinical outcomes of 66 patients (45 CIDP and 21 MMN) who were shifted from IVIg to SCIg.

All the CIDP and MMN patients treated with SCIg between 2009 and 2014 were considered, including patients with a previous documented response to IVIg (at least 6 months), and a wear-off effect between each IVIg infusion documented by a worsening of at least 1 point at the Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS).

Adherence to therapy was the primary outcome measure, while quality of life and clinical predictors of long-term disability were analysed as secondary outcomes. The clinical assessments were regularly performed by means of the ONLS, the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale in eight-muscle group bilaterally, and Life Quality Index (LQI). Clinical worsening was defined as increase of ≥1 ONLS point, requiring augmentation of SCIg dose, SCIg/IVIg combination therapy, or a return to IVIg for stabilising the clinical conditions. SCIg was administered at the patient's home, as previously described,1 converting the IVIg dose to an equivalent SCIg dose (20% solution of immunoglobulin ready-to-use) delivered via a programmable infusion pump. All patients signed a written informed consent, and ethical committee approval was obtained (CEI—629 Prot. n 0010675, 25 January 2013).

Reliable biomarkers for diagnosis, disease progression, and treatment response remain to be developed. We assessed the utility of corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) as a diagnostic marker for CIDP in 16 patients. CCM parameters including corneal nerve fiber density (NFD), nerve fiber length, number of main nerve trunks, number of nerve branches, nerve tortuosity, and dendritic cell density (DCD) were compared to those from 15 healthy controls and correlated with clinical and electrophysiological findings. CIDP patients had a significantly lower corneal NFD compared to healthy controls. The total nerve fiber length and the number of nerve branches were significantly decreased, whereas nerve tortuosity was increased in patients with CIDP. There was no positive correlation between corneal NFD and clinical or electrophysiological assessments. The average DCD was not significantly different in CIDP patients and controls. CCM measures suggest damage to small sensory afferents in the cornea in CIDP patients.

One hundred and fourteen newly diagnosed or relapsing patients (GBS: 55, CIDP: 59) were serially examined (1‐year follow‐up). The inflammatory Rasch‐built overall disability scale (I‐RODS), Rasch‐transformed MRC sum score (RT‐MRC), and Rasch‐transformed modified‐INCAT‐sensory scale (RT‐mISS) were assessed. Being‐a‐responder was defined as having a MCID‐SE cut‐off ≥1.96. Also, the correlations between patients' scores on each scale and the EuroQoL health‐status ‘thermometer’ (external criterion) were determined (higher correlation indicated better responsiveness). In both diseases, the SEs showed a characteristic ‘U’‐shaped dynamic pattern across each scales' continuum. The number of patients showing a meaningful change were higher for the I‐RODS > RT‐MRC > RT‐mISS and were in GBS higher than CIDP patients. The MCID‐SE concept using Rasch‐transformed data demonstrated an individual pattern of ‘being‐a‐responder’ in patients with immune‐mediated neuropathies, and the findings were validated by the external criterion responsiveness method. The I‐RODS showed greater responsiveness compared with the MRC and INCAT‐sensory scales, and its use is therefore recommended in future trials in GBS and CIDP.",27,['JournalArticle']

Methods In an observational trial, we prepared cryopreserved human peripheral blood monocytes from blood from 34 patients with CIDP (18 treatment naïve and 16 maintenance IVIg treatment) and from 14 healthy controls (non-immune neuropathy and healthy control). Treatment response was defined by clinical evaluation. The autoantigen-specific T-cell response was analysed by enzyme linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay before IVIg start (baseline) and at follow-up. The T-cell memory subsets were analysed by using flow cytometric analysis. Results Myelin-derived P2-specific and PMP-22-specific IFN-γ producers were increased in IVIg responders compared with non-responders before treatment, which decreased by repeated IVIg infusion cycles. Treatment responders but not non-responders showed higher frequencies of CD4 T effector memory (TEM) and T central memory frequencies at baseline compared with maintenance IVIg treatment patients and controls. In addition, IVIg treatment was associated with a significant reduction in CD8 TEM at follow-up. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that immunomodulatory treatment with IVIgs on a long-term basis reduces the autoreactive T-cell response against PMP-22 and P2-antigens, which may be influenced by the altered maintenance of CD8 and CD4 effector/memory T-cell subsets towards a more anti-inflammatory immune status. Elevated PMP-22 and P2-specific T-cell responses may serve as predictors for treatment responsiveness to IVIgs warranting validation in larger studies.",28,"['Study', 'JournalArticle']"

Methods: Peripheral blood leukocyte subsets, including classical CD14highCD16− and nonclassical inflammatory CD14lowCD16+ monocytes as well as naive CD19+CD27− and memory CD19+CD27+ B cells, were obtained at baseline and monitored at 2 and 4–8 weeks after initiation of IVIg therapy. Results: Compared with healthy donors matched by age and sex, patients with CIDP showed increased expression levels of the activating high-affinity FcγR1 on CD14highCD16− (p < 0.001) and CD14lowCD16+ monocytes (p < 0.001). Expression of the activating low-affinity FcγRIIA was increased on CD14lowCD16+ monocytes (p = 0.023). Conversely, expression of the inhibitory FcγRIIB was reduced on naive (p = 0.009) and memory (p = 0.002) B cells as well as on CD14highCD16− monocytes (p = 0.046). Clinically effective IVIg therapy partially restored deregulated FcγR expression on B cell subsets and monocytes. Conclusions: The FcγR regulatory system is disturbed in patients with CIDP. Balancing activating vs inhibitory FcγR expression might provide a clinical benefit for patients with CIDP.",12,['JournalArticle']

Objectives Explore the utility of VPT examination in CIDP patients. Methods CIDP subjects attending the Neuromuscular clinic between 01/2013 and 12/2014 were evaluated. Demographic data, clinical history, physical examination, VPT values, and electrophysiologic data from their charts were extracted. Results 70 charts were reviewed. 55 CIDP patients had elevated VPT, associated with higher frequency of abnormal sensory testing for various modalities (92.7% vs. 46.7%, p<0.0001), lower sensory and motor amplitudes and reduced conduction velocities on nerve conduction studies, and lower treatment response rates (54% vs. 93%, p = 0.01).

Methods: The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood was analyzed using CDR3 spectratyping. Patients with CIDP were included without (n = 14) and with IVIg treatment (n = 11) cross-sectionally and longitudinally (n = 2). Results: While the TCR length distribution of patients with CIDP was only moderately altered for most of the Vβ elements of CD4+ T cells, the CD8+ population displayed extensive oligoclonal expansions in all analyzed 24 Vβ elements. A public expansion of a distinct TCR length in one Vβ element within a majority of affected patients was not detectable. Treatment with IVIg reduced the oligoclonal expansions within both the CD4+ and CD8+ population. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells exhibit a much broader activation than CD4+ T cells, indicating a potentially crucial role of CD8+ T cells in the immunopathogenesis of CIDP. The profound oligoclonal response in T-cell activation suggests that multiple peptides may induce and propagate this autoimmune-driven disease. The observed reduction of highly activated T cells may contribute to the therapeutic effects of IVIg.",51,['JournalArticle']

Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been performed as a last treatment resort in a few therapy-refractory cases with CIDP. We describe the results of AHSCT in 11 consecutive Swedish patients with therapy-refractory CIDP with a median follow-up time of 28 months. Method Case data were gathered retrospectively for AHSCT treatments in 11 patients with CIDP refractory to the first-line immunomodulatory treatments, intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin, corticosteroids and plasma exchange and to one or more second-line treatments used in 10 of the 11 patients. Results The median Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) score within 1 month prior to AHSCT was 6 and the Rankin score 4. Total INCAT and Rankin scores improved significantly within 2–6 months after AHSCT and continued to do so at last follow-up. The motor action potential amplitudes (CMAP) improved already within 4 months (median) after AHSCT. Three of the 11 patients relapsed during the follow-up period, requiring retransplantation with AHSCT in one. Eight of the 11 patients maintained drug-free remission upon last follow-up. AHSCT was safe but on the short term associated with a risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–Barr virus reactivation, CMV disease, haemorrhagic cystitis and pancreatitis. Conclusions Our results though hampered by the limited number of patients and the lack of a control group suggest AHSCT to be efficacious in therapy-refractory CIDP, with a manageable complication profile. Confirmation of these results is necessary through randomised controlled trials.",50,['JournalArticle']

In addition to classical CIDP, there are many variant presentations, so-called atypical forms, such as pure motor, pure sensory, regional (restricted to the upper or lower limbs), multifocal (Lewis-Sumner syndrome), and distal patterns.2 The diagnosis of CIDP can be established when patients meet carefully delineated clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory criteria,1,2 but may be more challenging in cases with atypical presentations. Further difficulties arise when nerve conduction studies are inadequately performed or trivial nerve conduction abnormalities are labeled demyelinating.

Methods: We enrolled ten subjects with CIDP who had previously received IVIG in the hospital setting to receive the comparable IVIG dose (1-2 g/kg/month) in the home for six months. The patients were evaluated in the clinic at three months and at six months to evaluate their clinical status as well as the safety and tolerability of IVIG. Results: All subjects tolerated home-based IVIG treatment as maintenance treatment of CIDP. There were no serious adverse events related to IVIG. Subjects did experience “anticipated” IVIG events post-infusion such as headache and fatigue, which were managed with analgesics and supportive counseling. One subject withdrew consent at end of study due to hospitalization. This event was not related to the IVIG. Another subject experienced a “flare” of CIDP symptoms near the end of the study, however, completed all visits as per protocol.

The two disorders are sometimes confused both clinically and pathologically. The aim of this study was to clarify the differences in the pathology of large onion bulbs, focusing on the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Nine patients with CIDP and 14 with CMT1A were included. The opened interspaces in OB were frequently shown in CMT1A patients. In CIDP, interspaces of OB packed with collagen fibers were prominent. The mean ratio of opened OB was significantly increased in CMT1A (37.9%) compared to CIDP patients (10.6%) (p = 0.003). Among the ECM examined, tenascin-C (TNC) showed a distinct difference in the pattern of immunoreactivity of OB. The mean ratio of OB showing TNC immunoreactivity was significantly larger in CIDP (29.7%, p = 0.005) than in CMT1A (5.0%). TNC immunoreactivity was confined to the area around myelin sheaths in CMT1A. The increased deposition of collagen fibers in CIDP suggests the activity of nerve regeneration. TNC expression in Schwann cell lamellae comprising OB may also suggest the activity of regeneration. Schwann cell phenotypes in CIDP may be different from CMT1A regarding the production of ECM proteins.",10,['JournalArticle']

The nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) attributes that might differentiate POEMS from CIDP and lead to earlier therapeutic intervention were explored. Methods NCS/EMG of POEMS patients identified through retrospective review from 1960 to 2007 were compared with matched CIDP controls. Results 138 POEMS patients and 69 matched CIDP controls were compared. POEMS patients demonstrated length dependent reduction in compound muscle action potentials, low conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies and prolonged F wave latencies. Compared with CIDP controls, POEMS patients demonstrated: (1) greater reduction of motor amplitudes, (2) greater slowing of motor and sensory conduction velocities, (3) less prolonged motor distal latencies, (4) less frequent temporal dispersion and conduction block, (5) no sural sparing, (6) greater number of fibrillation potentials in a length dependent pattern and (7) higher terminal latency indices (TLI). TLI ≥0.38 in the median nerve demonstrated a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 77% in discriminating POEMS from CIDP. Conclusions NCS/EMG of POEMS syndrome suggests both axonal loss and demyelination. Compared with CIDP, there is greater axonal loss (reduction of motor amplitudes and increased fibrillation potentials), greater slowing of the intermediate nerve segments, less common temporal dispersion and conduction block, and absent sural sparing. These findings imply that the pathology of POEMS syndrome is diffusely distributed (uniform demyelination) along the nerve where the pathology of CIDP is probably predominantly proximal and distal. Median motor TLI may be useful in clinically distinguishing these disorders.",109,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']"

In this prospective cohort study we present long-term follow-up data on patients included in a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing 6 monthly pulses of dexamethasone with 8 months of daily prednisolone. Methods: Treatment effect was assessed with the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale and the Rivermead Mobility Index and was categorized using the CIDP Disease Activity Status (CDAS) scale. Results: By March 2011, 39 out of 40 patients were included with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. Cure (>5 years off treatment) or remission according to the CDAS criteria after 1 or 2 courses of pulsed dexamethasone or daily prednisolone was achieved in 10 out of 39 patients (26%). Half of the patients who were in remission after initial treatment experienced a relapse (median treatment-free interval: 17.5 months for dexamethasone, 11 months for prednisolone). Alternative diagnosis was made in 7 out of 12 (58%) who did not respond to any therapy and in none of the treatment-responsive patients. Conclusions: Cure or long-term remission can be achieved in about one-quarter of patients with CIDP after 1 or 2 courses of pulsed dexamethasone or 8-month daily prednisolone. In treatment-nonresponsive patients, the diagnosis CIDP should be reconsidered.

Neurological examination showed a waddling gait, difficulty in standing from the floor, limb-girdle weakness, and reduced deep tendon reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intramuscular hemangioma of the right semimembranosus muscle with a cranial–caudal extent of 27 mm and an axial diameter of 16 27 mm, characterized by enhancement after gadolinium infusion (Fig. 1). A Doppler ultrasound study of the main vascular axes of the 4 limbs showed no further vascular abnormalities. Hemangiomas are benign lesions of the blood vessels that occur mainly in the head and neck regions. They occupy a gray zone between true neoplasms and hamartomatous malformations. Although they are frequently regarded as tumors, the lack of chromosomal alterations argues against a true neoplastic origin. The incidence of hemangiomas in the general newborn population is between 1.1% and 2.6%. They are usually present at birth or appear soon afterward. Intramuscular hemangiomas are quite rare tumors, which arise most frequently in the masseter and trapezius muscles. They comprise 0.8% of all hemangiomas. Patients may have soft-tissue complaints, such as pain and swelling. Their location may present a considerable therapeutic challenge in cases of accelerated tumor growth, intractable pain, functional impairment, risk of local skin necrosis, thrombocytopenia, cosmetic deformity, or suspicion of malignancy. Although we cannot completely rule out a coincidental relationship in our patient, our report should lead clinicians who care for GSDII patients to consider the possibility of an intramuscular hemangioma when clinically appropriate.",17,"['LettersAndComments', 'CaseReport']"

On the basis of randomized controlled studies, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and plasmapheresis provide short‐term benefits in CIDP. MMN responds only to IVIg. Because in MMN and CIDP, IVIg infusions are required every 3–6 weeks to sustain benefits or long‐term remissions, there is a need for “IVIg‐sparing” agents. In CIDP, immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and cyclophosphamide, are used, but controlled trials have not shown that they are effective. Controlled trials have also not shown benefit to any agents in anti‐MAG neuropathy. However, clinicians use many immunosuppressive drugs in both settings, but all have potentially serious side effects and are only effective in some patients. Thus, there is a need for new therapies in the inflammatory and paraproteinemic neuropathies. New agents targeting T cells, B cells, and transmigration and transduction molecules are discussed as potential treatment options for new trials. The need for biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses or identify patients with active disease is emphasized, and the search for better scoring tools that capture meaningful changes after response to therapies is highlighted.",32,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']"

Methods Serum antibodies to LM1, a mixture of GM1 and LM1 (GM1/LM1), and that of GD1b and LM1 (GD1b/LM1) were examined in 75 consecutive patients with CIDP. The clinical features of the CIDP patients with such antibodies in the present series and those in the previous reports were investigated and compared with those of antibody-negative patients. Results Of the 75 patients with CIDP, two had antibodies to LM1, three had anti-GM1/LM1 complex antibody, one had anti-GD1b/LM1 complex antibody and two had antibodies to both the GM1/LM1 and GD1b/LM1 complexes. Patients with the LM1-associated antibodies did not have cranial nerve deficits (p<0.05) and exhibited ataxia more frequently than the antibody-negative patients (p<0.01).

Background: The distinction between Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with fluctuations shortly after start of treatment (treatment-related fluctuations, or GBS-TRF) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with acute onset (A-CIDP) is difficult but important because prognosis and treatment strategy largely differ. Methods: Patients with GBS (n = 170) were included in a prospective longitudinal study. Patients with GBS-TRF (n = 16) and patients with A-CIDP (n = 8) were analyzed and compared. Extended clinical data, biologic material, and electrophysiologic data were collected during 1 year follow-up. Results: The first TRF in the GBS-TRF group always occurred within 8 weeks (median 18 days; range 10–54 days) from onset of weakness. In the GBS-TRF group, 5 (31%) patients had a second TRF and none had more TRFs. At all timepoints, patients in the A-CIDP group were less severely affected than patients with GBS-TRF, did not need artificial ventilation, rarely had cranial nerve dysfunction, and tended to have more CIDP-like electrophysiologic abnormalities. More GBS-TRF patients were severely affected and more patients had sensory disturbances when compared to the GBS group without fluctuations. Conclusions: The diagnosis of acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) should be considered when a patient thought to have Guillain-Barré syndrome deteriorates again after 8 weeks from onset or when deterioration occurs 3 times or more. Especially when the patient remains able to walk independently and has no cranial nerve dysfunction or electrophysiologic features likely to be compatible with CIDP, maintenance treatment for CIDP should be considered.",244,['JournalArticle']

Motor nerve conduction studies were completely normal. Sensory electrophysiology showed reduced/absent upper limb sensory action potentials (SAPs). In the lower limbs, SAPs were mostly normal. Sensory conduction velocities were normal. Forearm sensory conduction blocks were present for both median nerves on antidromic testing. The maximal recordable sural SAP was preserved in comparison to maximal recordable radial SAP, consistent with an ""abnormal radial normal sural"" pattern. Somatosensory evoked potentials were unrecordable for tibial and median nerves. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was raised (0.99 g/L). The patient worsened on oral corticosteroids but subsequently made substantial functional recovery on intravenous immunoglobulins. This case is different to those previously reported of sensory chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, given its exclusive sensory electrophysiologic presentation, presence of predominant upper limb reduced sensory amplitudes, and detection of sensory conduction blocks. These electrophysiologic features were of paramount importance in establishing diagnosis and effective therapy.",25,"['JournalArticle', 'CaseReport']"

These studies focused on compact myelin proteins and peptides as targets of immune attack in Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and EAN. However, serological studies in patients with subsets of GBS highlighted the importance of gangliosides – glycolipids enriched in non‐compact Schwann cell regions and the node, paranodal, and internodal axolemma. In the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) rabbit model, antibodies to the ganglioside GM1 bind in the nodal region, impair Na channel clustering and disturb Schwann cell/axon organisation. Schwann cell neurobiological studies now highlight the importance of adhesion molecules, including neurofascins, gliomedin, contactins, and NrCAM to Schwann cell/axon integrity. Changes to nodal fine structure by immune responses against such molecules may provide a mechanism for reversible conduction failure or block. Recovery of patients with CIDP or multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) following treatment may sometimes be better explained by reversal of conduction failure than remyelination or regeneration. This review considers the importance of the intricate molecular arrangements at the nodal and paranodal regions in inflammatory neuropathies such as CIDP. Early images of compact myelin stripping and phagocytosis, may have diverted the research focus away from these vital non‐compact myelin Schwann cell areas.",65,"['Review', 'JournalArticle']"

This condition is often underdiagnosed due to the frequent absence of these classical clinical features as well as abnormalities that arise during confirmatory tests. Current diagnostic tests involve the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, nerve biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and treatment response. Due to the clinical heterogeneity of the condition and a lack of a consistent confirmatory test, a variety of diagnostic criteria were developed. At least 14 different sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed that each have varying diagnostic sensitivities. Although the diagnostic tests used within these criteria are useful, they individually offer evidence to support, rather than definitively confirm, the diagnosis of CIDP. Currently, there is no biomarker that can reliably identify all patients with CIDP, but it is evident that such a biomarker is urgently needed to ensure effective disease management.",42,['JournalArticle']

In GBS, patients show a large variability in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels after standard IVIg treatment and a large increase in serum IgG levels (ΔIgG) was associated with a better outcome. Whether this is also the case in CIDP is not known. In contrast to GBS, most patients with CIDP need regular IVIg treatment for a prolonged period of time but the speed and magnitude of clinical response varies considerably between patients. Some patients with CIDP may need at least two IVIg courses before clinical signs of improvement become clear. At present, this clinical response is the only indicator used to adjust the IVIg dose and interval during maintenance treatment. Biomarkers reflecting disease activity or IVIg pharmacokinetics might be helpful to monitor patients and find the optimal dosage and frequency of IVIg treatment for individual patients. A recent prospective study in CIDP indicated that the increased ΔIgG after standard IVIg dosage during maintenance treatment was relatively constant within individual patients, but differed considerably between patients who were treated with the same stable dosage and interval of IVIg. Further studies are required to determine whether this variation in pharmacokinetics of IVIg is related with clinical recovery and whether IgG levels can be used as biomarkers to monitor and to adjust the optimal IVIg dosage in individual patients with CIDP.",25,['JournalArticle']

The heterogeneity in therapeutic responses necessitates the need to search for biomarkers to determine the most suitable therapy from the outset and explore the best means for monitoring disease activity. The ICE study, which led to the first FDA‐approved indication for IVIg in CIDP, has shown that maintenance therapy prevents relapses and axonal loss. In this paper, the multiple actions exerted by IVIg on the immunoregulatory network of CIDP are discussed as potential predictors of response to therapies. Emerging molecular markers, promising in identifying responders to IVIg from non‐responders, include modulation of FcγRIIB receptors on monocytes and genome‐wide transcription studies related to inflammatory mediators, demyelination, or axonal degeneration. Skin biopsies, Peripheral Blood Lymhocytes, CSF, and sera are accessible surrogate tissues for further exploring these molecules during therapies.",24,['JournalArticle']

Primary demyelination can be detected by electrodiagnostic studies or nerve biopsy, but these do not distinguish between demyelination resulting from CIDP or from non‐inflammatory causes such as diabetes or Charcot–Marie–Tooth type I. Consequently, the diagnosis of CIDP in such patients is often missed. Studies are needed to establish electrodiagnostic criteria for CIDP in patients with diabetes, and to identify biomarkers that distinguish between inflammatory and non‐inflammatory causes of demyelinating neuropathy.",21,['JournalArticle']
