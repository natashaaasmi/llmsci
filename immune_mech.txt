Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nerves that presents with either chronic progression or relapsing disease. Recent studies in samples from patients with CIDP and mouse models have delineated how defects in central (thymic) and peripheral (extrathymic) immune tolerance mechanisms can cause PNS autoimmunity. Notably, nerve parenchymal cells actively contribute to local autoimmunity and also control disease outcome. Here, we outline how emerging technologies increasingly enable an integrated view of how immune cells and PNS parenchymal cells communicate in CIDP. We also relate the known heterogeneity of clinical presentation with specific underlying mechanisms. For example, a severe subtype of CIDP with tremor is associated with pathogenic IgG4 autoantibodies against nodal and paranodal proteins. An improved understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in CIDP will form the basis for more effective mechanism-based therapies.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nerves and nerve roots. It is the most common chronic autoimmune neuropathy in humans and is estimated to affect up to 1 in 10,000 individuals (1). Although multiple subtypes and variants of chronic inflammatory neuropathies with diverse corresponding acronyms have been described, CIDP remains the most common form, and we specifically focus here on CIDP and CIDP models. Although the first descriptions of patients potentially originated in the 1800s, CIDP was first described as “one nosologic entity” by Peter Dyck and colleagues in 1975 (2). CIDP is characterized by symmetric loss of motor and sensory function, and diagnostic tests demonstrate electrophysiological and histological evidence of demyelination. Additional pathologic features include interstitial edema, “onion bulb” formation, which is indicative of repeated demyelination and remyelination episodes, and endoneurial inflammatory cell infiltrates composed of monocytes and lymphocytes.

For most patients, the clinical course of CIDP progresses slowly: however, one-third of patients can present with relapsing-remitting disease (3), which by definition progresses or relapses for more than eight weeks. This time-course distinguishes CIDP from acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (AIDP) and other subtypes of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which are monophasic and usually peak within three to four weeks; although, their clinical course is also very heterogeneous. Triggered by the success of its counterpart in GBS (4, 5), the International CIDP Outcome Study (ICOS) was recently launched to better define CIDP heterogeneity and identify clinical and biological outcome determinants (6). This prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study promises to provide a wealth of information about the natural history of CIDP.

Unlike most other chronic neuropathies, CIDP is treatable, albeit with considerable socioeconomic implications and variable success. Current mainstays of CIDP therapy are glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and plasmapheresis. With current therapies, only 11% of patients with CIDP experienced stable disease lasting more than 5 years off therapy (7). Moreover, 12% of patients had a progressive or relapsing course despite treatment and 51% required continued treatment to prevent disease progression. Thus, more specific, effective therapies for CIDP are desirable, and understanding the underlying pathogenesis will facilitate their development. This Review will synthesize recent advances in understanding CIDP pathogenesis and discuss emerging technologies that hold promise in revealing new aspects of underlying disease mechanisms.

Using animal models to understand CIDP

Animal models have been instrumental in understanding the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory neuropathies (8, 9). CIDP mouse models have been developed, of which multiple are on the autoimmune-prone NOD background. This predisposition for PNS autoimmunity on the NOD background is likely due to genetic loci (including the NOD-specific H-2g7 MHC region) that confer general susceptibility to autoimmunity (10). NOD models of CIDP include (a) NOD.AireGW/+ mice, which have a dominant loss-of-function G228W mutation in the autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene (11, 12); (b) NOD.ICAM1tm1Jcgr mice, which express alternative splice isoforms of the adhesion molecule ICAM1 (13); (c) NOD.B7-2–/– mice, which lack costimulatory molecule B7-2 (also known as CD86) (14); and (d) NOD.H-2b.PD-1–/– mice, which express the antidiabetogenic MHC H-2b haplotype and lack PD-1 (9, 15). These mice all display multiple features of CIDP, including spontaneous demyelination and immune cell infiltration of peripheral nerves. Importantly, PNS autoimmunity develops spontaneously in these models without the need for antigen/adjuvant immunization, mirroring the clinical observation that CIDP most often develops without antecedent triggers.
Animal models have led to the identification of tolerance mechanisms important in preventing PNS autoimmunity. Two decades ago, Gold et al. showed that, although the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) prevents cells from randomly migrating into the PNS, the peripheral nerve is under constant immune surveillance by T and B cells and macrophages (16). A specialized immune response takes place in the PNS that offers immune protection as well as rapid elimination of inflammation within the tissue (17). However, if immunologic tolerance is lost, these same cell types may become activated toward autoantigens expressed by the peripheral nerve cells and an autoimmune polyneuropathy may develop (18). CIDP mouse models have allowed in vivo dissection of how loss of tolerance can initiate and enhance autoimmune responses in the PNS.
PNS-specific tolerance mechanisms
Tissue autoimmunity is prevented by a series of central (thymic) and peripheral (extrathymic) immune tolerance mechanisms, which restrain the development and activation of self-reactive lymphocytes. Strong evidence exists that shows that central tolerance mediated by the Aire gene plays a major role in preventing PNS autoimmunity (Figure 1A). Within thymic epithelial cells, Aire normally induces expression of thousands of self-antigens (an “immunological mirror image” of the proteome). Recognition of these self-antigens by developing T cells leads to their negative selection or conversion into immunosuppressive Tregs. This core process of central tolerance prevents the release of self-reactive T effector cells into the periphery and subsequent development of autoimmunity. Multiple lines of evidence support Aire as critical for preventing PNS autoimmunity by upregulating expression of PNS-specific antigens in the thymus.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nerves and nerve roots. It is the most common chronic autoimmune neuropathy in humans and is estimated to affect up to 1 in 10,000 individuals (1). Although multiple subtypes and variants of chronic inflammatory neuropathies with diverse corresponding acronyms have been described, CIDP remains the most common form, and we specifically focus here on CIDP and CIDP models.

Using animal models to understand CIDP
Animal models have been instrumental in understanding the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory neuropathies (8, 9). CIDP mouse models have been developed, of which multiple are on the autoimmune-prone NOD background. This predisposition for PNS autoimmunity on the NOD background is likely due to genetic loci (including the NOD-specific H-2g7 MHC region) that confer general susceptibility to autoimmunity (10).

These mice all display multiple features of CIDP, including spontaneous demyelination and immune cell infiltration of peripheral nerves. Importantly, PNS autoimmunity develops spontaneously in these models without the need for antigen/adjuvant immunization, mirroring the clinical observation that CIDP most often develops without antecedent triggers.

Animal models have led to the identification of tolerance mechanisms important in preventing PNS autoimmunity. Two decades ago, Gold et al. showed that, although the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) prevents cells from randomly migrating into the PNS, the peripheral nerve is under constant immune surveillance by T and B cells and macrophages (16). A specialized immune response takes place in the PNS that offers immune protection as well as rapid elimination of inflammation within the tissue (17).

CIDP mouse models have allowed in vivo dissection of how loss of tolerance can initiate and enhance autoimmune responses in the PNS.

PNS-specific tolerance mechanisms
Tissue autoimmunity is prevented by a series of central (thymic) and peripheral (extrathymic) immune tolerance mechanisms, which restrain the development and activation of self-reactive lymphocytes. Strong evidence exists that shows that central tolerance mediated by the Aire gene plays a major role in preventing PNS autoimmunity (Figure 1A). Within thymic epithelial cells, Aire normally induces expression of thousands of self-antigens (an “immunological mirror image” of the proteome). Recognition of these self-antigens by developing T cells leads to their negative selection or conversion into immunosuppressive Tregs. This core process of central tolerance prevents the release of self-reactive T effector cells into the periphery and subsequent development of autoimmunity. Multiple lines of evidence support Aire as critical for preventing PNS autoimmunity by upregulating expression of PNS-specific antigens in the thymus. Patients with loss-of-function AIRE mutations develop a multiorgan autoimmune syndrome that includes a CIDP-like phenotype as a component (19). Additionally, NOD mice with a dominant loss-of-function Aire G228W mutation (NOD.AireGW/+) spontaneously develop PNS autoimmunity that shares multiple CIDP features. Although the PNS-specific antigen myelin protein zero (abbreviated P0 or MPZ) is expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells of WT mice, it is absent in NOD.AireGW/+ mice, suggesting that Aire normally upregulates P0 expression in the thymus to protect against PNS autoimmunity (12). Consistent with a model in which defective negative selection of P0-reactive T cells leads to PNS autoimmunity, NOD.AireGW/+ mice have increased P0-specific cells in the periphery and elevated P0-specific autoantibodies in serum (ref. 12 and Figure 1A). Together, these findings suggest that Aire plays an important role in enforcing immune tolerance toward the PNS in both humans and mice.
